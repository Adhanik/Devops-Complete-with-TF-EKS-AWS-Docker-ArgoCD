# When i am accessing a application which is hosted on Kb pods, how does the DNS resolution, if its the correct term happens? Suppose i have a ingress controller of type nginx which watches over my ingress resource and creates a NLB load balancer, now when i try to access the application FQDN, the load balancer routes traffic to that ingress, which forwards to service, and service to pod. I want to know this process in detail, what happens at all levels, like LB level, IC level, service and then pod level. Does LB automatically gets my laptop/wifi IP, forwards it to ingress? Like this it works or how all things happen


# SOL

Your understanding of the process is generally correct, but let's break it down step-by-step, focusing on DNS resolution, load balancing, and traffic routing in a Kubernetes (K8s) environment where you have an NGINX Ingress Controller and a Network Load Balancer (NLB). 

### 1. **DNS Resolution** When you type the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of your application into a browser, the DNS (Domain Name System) resolution process begins: 

- **DNS Lookup:** Your local DNS resolver (usually configured by your ISP or corporate network) sends a query to the DNS hierarchy to resolve the FQDN into an IP address. This involves querying a series of DNS servers, starting from the root servers down to the authoritative DNS server for your domain. 

- **FQDN to IP Mapping:** The authoritative DNS server for your domain (which could be managed by a DNS service like Route 53 if you're using AWS) returns the IP address of your Network Load Balancer (NLB) associated with the FQDN. 

### 2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB) Level** - **Incoming Traffic:** Once the DNS resolution returns the IP of the NLB, your browser sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to this IP address. 

- **Connection Handling:** The NLB, which operates at the transport layer (Layer 4), forwards the request to one of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. The selection of the node is based on the NLB's load balancing algorithm, which might be round-robin, least connections, or another method. 

- **Node Target:** The NLB doesn’t have to know your laptop’s IP address. It only needs to forward the incoming traffic to one of the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. ### 

3. **Ingress Controller (NGINX) Level** 

- **Traffic Routing to Ingress Resource:** Once the traffic reaches the node, the NGINX Ingress Controller running on that node inspects the request to determine which Ingress resource (based on the hostname and path) should handle it. 

- **Ingress Resource Match:** The Ingress Controller finds the matching Ingress resource that corresponds to the requested FQDN and path. The Ingress resource then directs the traffic to the appropriate Kubernetes Service. 

### 4. **Kubernetes Service Level** - **Service Selection:** The Kubernetes Service acts as a logical abstraction that defines a set of pods. Services are defined with a selector that matches labels on the Pods. 


- **Service to Pod Traffic:** The Service routes the request to one of the matching Pods. If the Service is of type `ClusterIP`, the request is routed internally within the cluster. 

If it's of type `NodePort`, the request is forwarded from a node to the Service's internal cluster IP, which then directs it to a pod. 

For a `LoadBalancer` type Service, the cloud provider will create an external load balancer and route the traffic to the Service. 

### 5. **Pod Level** - **Pod Selection:** The request is forwarded to one of the Pods that match the Service’s selector. Kubernetes uses kube-proxy (or a similar proxy) running on each node to handle the actual routing of traffic from the Service to the Pod. 

- **Pod Response:** The selected Pod processes the request and generates a response. This response is sent back through the Service, Ingress Controller, and finally back to the Load Balancer, which forwards it to the client (your laptop). 

### Summary of Flow: 

1. **DNS**: FQDN → NLB IP. 
2. **NLB**: Client request → Kubernetes node. 
3. **Ingress Controller**: Node → Ingress resource based on hostname/path. 
4. **Service**: Ingress → Service → matching Pods. 
5. **Pod**: Service → Pod → process request and respond.

 ### How IP Addresses are Managed: 
 
 - **Client IP Address:** The client’s IP (your laptop’s IP) is typically preserved and passed through as an HTTP header (like `X-Forwarded-For`) so that the Ingress Controller and applications can access it if needed. 
 
 - **NLB IP Address:** The NLB routes the traffic based on the node IPs; it doesn't need to know the client’s IP address for routing within the cluster. This is a high-level overview, and specific implementations can vary based on the Kubernetes setup, cloud provider, and configuration details.

 # Q2 - According to you, The dns lookup would give my load balancer ip, when i type the website fqdn in web? And then browser sends http/https request to ip address of NLB, which it got from DNS resolution. Is it correct understanding? And why does the dns resolver returns ip address of NLB? Secondly does it mean that if i search chatgpt.com in my browser, my browser receives a load balancer ip of chatgpt LB on which chatgpt is hosted?

Yes, your understanding is correct. Let me clarify each part: 

### 1. **DNS Lookup and NLB IP Address Resolution** 

- **DNS Lookup:** When you type a website's Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (like `example.com`) into your browser, your computer sends a DNS query to resolve that domain name into an IP address. This query is handled by a DNS resolver, which could be provided by your ISP, a public DNS service (like Google DNS), or your corporate network. 

- **DNS Response:** The DNS resolver consults the DNS hierarchy and ultimately gets a response from the authoritative DNS server for that domain. The response contains the IP address that corresponds to the domain name you entered. - **NLB IP Address:** If the domain name (`example.com`) is hosted on a cloud provider (like AWS, GCP, Azure) with a load balancer (like a Network Load Balancer - NLB), the DNS server will return the IP address of that load balancer. This is because the load balancer is responsible for distributing incoming traffic to the backend servers (in this case, Kubernetes nodes or instances). 

### 2. **HTTP/HTTPS Request to NLB** 

- **HTTP/HTTPS Request:** After your browser receives the IP address from the DNS lookup, it sends an HTTP or HTTPS request to that IP address. The IP address in this case is the public IP of the load balancer (NLB). 

- **Traffic Routing:** The NLB, which has been assigned that IP address, receives the request and routes it to one of the backend servers (e.g., Kubernetes nodes) based on its load-balancing algorithm. The backend servers then further route the request to the appropriate services and pods, as described in the previous explanation. 

### 3. **Why the DNS Resolver Returns the IP Address of the NLB** 

- **DNS Configuration:** The reason the DNS resolver returns the IP address of the NLB is because that's how the domain is configured. In the DNS records (specifically, in the A or CNAME records), the domain name (`example.com`) is associated with the IP address of the load balancer. This setup allows the load balancer to handle all incoming traffic for that domain, distributing it to the appropriate backend resources. 

### 4. **Example with ChatGPT.com** 

- **ChatGPT.com Example:** If you enter `chatgpt.com` into your browser, your browser initiates a DNS query to resolve the domain name to an IP address. - **DNS Response for ChatGPT:** The DNS resolver would return the IP address of the load balancer that OpenAI (the organization behind ChatGPT) uses to manage traffic for that domain. This load balancer could be on a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure. 

- **Request Handling:** Your browser would then send an HTTP or HTTPS request to the IP address returned by the DNS query, which would be the IP of the load balancer managing traffic for `chatgpt.com`. The load balancer would then distribute the request to one of the backend servers (or a Kubernetes service, if it's part of a Kubernetes deployment) that actually runs the ChatGPT service. 

### Summary 

- **DNS Lookup:** Resolves the FQDN to the IP address of the load balancer (NLB) that manages traffic for that domain. 

- **NLB Handling:** The browser sends a request to the IP of the NLB, which routes the traffic to the appropriate backend server or service. 

- **Example with ChatGPT:** Your browser receives the IP of the load balancer when you search for `chatgpt.com`, and that IP is where the request is initially sent. This setup is common in modern web applications, where load balancers play a critical role in managing and distributing incoming traffic efficiently across multiple servers or services.


### Local DNS resolution

# Q3

• FQDN to IP Mapping: The authoritative DNS server for your domain (which could be managed by a DNS service like Route 53 if you’re using AWS) returns the IP address of your Network Load Balancer (NLB) associated with the FQDN. 1. Also this point, i dont have a DNS service like route 53, then how does my LB ip is returned? 2. Also when i type in a fqdn, u send my local dns resolver sends query to DNS hierrachy to resolve fqdn into IP address. But my fqdn is not listed, like i have not published this fqdn like google.com. My fqdn is simple abc.local which i have mentioned in my ingress.yaml infront of host, and in /etc/hosts file, i have mapped this host to Load balancer IP. But this fqdn is not published, so how my local dns will resolve this fqdn to Ip address?


# SOL

Great questions! Let's address them one by one. 

### 1. **What If You Don't Have a DNS Service Like Route 53?** 

If you don't use a DNS service like Route 53, the resolution of your FQDN to an IP address depends on how your domain is managed and configured: 

- **Self-Managed DNS Server:** You might be managing your own DNS server. If so, the authoritative DNS server for your domain is the one that you have configured. When a DNS query for your domain is made, it will hit your DNS server, which would have the necessary DNS records (like A or CNAME records) to resolve the FQDN to the IP address of your Network Load Balancer (NLB). 

- **DNS Managed by a Third Party:** If you registered your domain with a domain registrar, they often provide DNS services as well. You would set up DNS records through their management interface, pointing your FQDN to your NLB's IP address. - **Internal or Private DNS:** In some cases, especially in corporate or private networks, you might be using an internal DNS server that isn't public. In this case, DNS resolution happens within your private network and isn't accessible from the public internet. This DNS server would return the IP of the NLB when queried with the FQDN. 


### 2. **Resolving a Local FQDN (e.g., `abc.local`)** 

When dealing with a local FQDN like `abc.local`, the situation is quite different from resolving a public domain like `google.com`. 

Here's how it works: 

- **Local DNS Resolution:** If `abc.local` is not a publicly registered domain, it won't be found on public DNS servers. Instead, local resolution methods are used. There are a few ways this can be set up: 

- **Hosts File:** As you mentioned, you have configured `/etc/hosts` on your machine to map `abc.local` to the IP address of the Load Balancer. When you type `abc.local` into your browser, your operating system checks the `/etc/hosts` file before making any DNS query. If it finds a matching entry, it directly uses the IP address specified in the file and doesn't need to query any external DNS server. 


- **Internal DNS Servers:** In a private or corporate network, `abc.local` could be resolved by an internal DNS server configured to handle local domain names. These internal DNS servers are not part of the public DNS hierarchy, and they only resolve queries within the internal network. 


- **mDNS (Multicast DNS):** For domains like `.local`, some systems use mDNS (Multicast DNS) to resolve these addresses on the local network without involving traditional DNS servers. However, this is more common for devices and services that need to be discovered on a local network rather than configured FQDNs in a Kubernetes Ingress. 

### **Detailed Flow for Your Setup** 

1. **Local Resolution (Hosts File):** - You type `abc.local` in your browser. - Your operating system first checks the `/etc/hosts` file. - It finds an entry for `abc.local` and maps it to the IP address of your Load Balancer. - The browser then sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to that IP address. 

2. **Traffic Routing via Load Balancer:** - The Load Balancer receives the request and forwards it to one of the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. - The NGINX Ingress Controller on that node processes the request based on the `Host` header (`abc.local`) and routes it to the appropriate service. - The service forwards the request to the correct pod, which processes the request and returns a response. 

### **Summary** - **Without a Public DNS Service:** 

If you're not using a service like Route 53 and don't have a public DNS setup, your DNS resolution is handled either by a self-managed DNS server, a third-party DNS service provided by your domain registrar, or through local methods like the `/etc/hosts` file or an internal DNS server. - **Local FQDN (`abc.local`):** The resolution of `abc.local` is handled entirely locally via the `/etc/hosts` file, and no external DNS servers are queried. The browser directly sends the request to the IP specified in the hosts file. This setup is common in development environments or for internal services that don't need to be publicly accessible.
