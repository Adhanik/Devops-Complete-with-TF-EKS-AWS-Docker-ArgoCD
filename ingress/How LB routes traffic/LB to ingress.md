In your setup, the Network Load Balancer (NLB) created by the NGINX Ingress Controller plays a crucial role in managing and routing external traffic to your services running inside your private subnets. Here’s a breakdown of how it works and its key concepts:

### 1. **Ingress Controller and Load Balancer**

**Ingress Controller:**
- The NGINX Ingress Controller listens for Ingress resources in your Kubernetes cluster.
- It manages and configures the NGINX reverse proxy to route traffic based on the rules defined in Ingress resources.

**Load Balancer (NLB):**
- When you install and configure the NGINX Ingress Controller, it automatically provisions an AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) to handle incoming traffic.
- The NLB is external-facing and publicly accessible, bridging the gap between the outside world and your private Kubernetes nodes.

### 2. **How the Load Balancer Works**

1. **Public Exposure:**
   - The NLB has a public IP or DNS name (e.g., `a75e27930a8bd40c5****************4f.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`) that external users can access.
   - This public DNS name or IP is what you use to access your application from the internet.

2. **Traffic Routing:**
   - When a user accesses `go-web-app.local` (which you mapped to the NLB’s DNS name in `/etc/hosts`), the request is routed to the NLB.
   - The NLB forwards the request to the NGINX Ingress Controller running inside your Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Internal Communication:**
   - The NGINX Ingress Controller processes the request according to the rules defined in your `Ingress` resource.
   - It then routes the request to the appropriate Kubernetes Service (`go-web-app` in your case), which in turn directs the traffic to the correct Pod(s) running your application.

4. **Nodes in Private Subnets:**
   - The NLB handles all incoming traffic and routes it to the Ingress Controller without exposing the internal nodes directly.
   - Your worker nodes are in private subnets and are not directly accessible from the internet. The NLB ensures that traffic is properly directed to the services running on these nodes.

### 3. **Security Considerations**

- **Access Control:**
  - The NLB itself is publicly accessible, but it only exposes the NGINX Ingress Controller. Direct access to Kubernetes nodes is restricted because they are in private subnets.
  - You can configure security groups and Network ACLs to further restrict access to the NLB and control what traffic is allowed.

- **TLS/SSL Termination:**
  - For secure communication, you can configure TLS/SSL termination at the NGINX Ingress Controller level, where it decrypts HTTPS traffic and forwards it as HTTP to backend services. This ensures that traffic between the client and the Ingress Controller is encrypted.

- **Health Checks:**
  - The NLB performs health checks on the Ingress Controller to ensure it routes traffic only to healthy endpoints.

- **Scaling and Load Distribution:**
  - The NLB distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of the Ingress Controller and balances the load, ensuring high availability and reliability.

### 4. **Key Functions of Load Balancers**

- **Routing Traffic:** Directs incoming requests to the appropriate backend servers or services based on configured rules.
- **Handling Failures:** Monitors the health of backend instances and routes traffic only to healthy instances.
- **Scaling:** Distributes incoming traffic evenly across multiple instances, which helps manage load and prevent any single instance from becoming a bottleneck.
- **SSL Termination:** Can offload SSL decryption from backend servers, reducing their load and simplifying certificate management.

### Summary

In your case, the NLB provides a public entry point for traffic, which is then routed to the NGINX Ingress Controller. The Ingress Controller manages routing rules and directs traffic to the appropriate service inside your Kubernetes cluster. Nodes remain in private subnets, ensuring they are not directly accessible from the internet, which enhances security.

By configuring your `/etc/hosts` file, you can simulate DNS resolution locally, allowing you to test and access your application using a custom domain name.
